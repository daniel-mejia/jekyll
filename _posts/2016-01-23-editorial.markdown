description: Astronomy magazine is a publication about the discovery of the great cosmos. Their first and only article never published is about black holes and their awesomeness. Astronomy magazine's logo was designed by me and all images provided by <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html" target="_blank">NASA</a>.<p>Experimentart is a magazine about art, music and design. This layout is for an interview made to artist <a href="http://iri5.com/" target="_blank">iri5</a> and her very nostalgic yet original creations.</p>
