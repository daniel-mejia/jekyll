description: While living in the British Virgin Islands I worked for Island Publishing Services, a tourist guide publishing company. Responsible for the design of publications, maintaining the website and leading social media efforts. I gave the magazine a fresh look to attract new readers from tourists visiting the island and proud locals alike.<p>My biggest challenge while working with Island Publishing Services was having to document with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bviwelcome/" target="_blank">pictures</a> some of the islandâ€™s most famous spots and fun activities then share them with future visitors (what a drag :P).</p>
